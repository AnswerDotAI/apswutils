# sqlite-minutils


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

First, import the sqlite-miniutils library. Through the use of the
**all** attribute in our Python modules by using `import *` we only
bring in the `Database`, `Queryable`, `Table`, `View` classes. There’s
no risk of namespace pollution.

``` python
from sqlite_minutils.db import *
```

Then we create a SQLite database. For the sake of convienance we’re
doing it in-memory with the `:memory:` special string. If you wanted
something more persistent, name it something not surrounded by colons,
`data.db` is a common file name.

``` python
db = Database(":memory:")
```

Let’s drop (aka ‘delete’) any tables that might exist. These docs also
serve as a test harness, and we want to make certain we are starting
with a clean slate. This also serves as a handy sneak preview of some of
the features of this library.

``` python
for t in db.tables: t.drop()
```

User tables are a handy way to create a useful example with some
real-world meaning. To do this, we first instantiate the `users` table
object:

``` python
users = Table(db, 'Users')
users
```

    <Table Users (does not exist yet)>

The table doesn’t exist yet, so let’s add some columns via the
`Table.create` method:

``` python
users.create(columns=dict(name=str, age=int))
users
```

    <Table Users (name, age)>

What if we need to change the table structure?

For example User tables often include things like password field. Let’s
add that now via the `Table.transform` method. We should now see that
the `users` table now has the `pwd:str` field added.

``` python
users.transform(types=dict(name=str, age=int, pwd=str))
users
```

    <Table Users (name, age)>
